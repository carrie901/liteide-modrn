# Modrn Theme for LiteIDE

A very minimal theme with light and dark variants. Once I get my hands on icons, I’ll replace the original ones.

## Installation

###### To install on OSX:

1. Navigate to the LiteIDE.app (generally in Applications).
2. Right click and show package contents.
3. Navigate to LiteIDE.app/Contents/Resources/liteapp/qss/ and place modrn-dark.qss (or modrn-light.xml) inside.
4. Navigate to LiteIDE.app/Contents/Resources/liteeditor/color/ and place modrn-dark.qss (or modrn-light.xml) inside.

6. Go to LiteIDE preferences.
7. In preferences, go to the LiteApp pane (side menu), then go to the Generic pane (top menu), then click on the dropdown labelled theme, select modrn-dark.qss or modrn-light.qss.
8. In preferences, go to the LiteEditor pane (side menu), then go to the Fonts & Colors pane (top menu), then click on the dropdown labelled “Editor Color Scheme”, select modrn-dark.xml or modrn-light.xml.

1. Have fun!

## Future

Icons need to be added to replace the defaults. Perhaps tone down the blue in the dark variant as well.
